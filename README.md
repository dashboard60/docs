## What is this?

**Dashboard60** is a [dashboard template](https://www.janlosert.com/dashboard-ui-kit-2017) designed by [Jan Losert](https://www.janlosert.com/). The idea was to create a free-to-use and open-source HTML dashboard template. We all love [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and the vast majority of dashboard templates were written using it. However, the main goal is to write this project using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Why? Read [this](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/).

The developers facing a lack of free and useful themes. Moreover, paid ones did not solve this problem.

The main goal of this project is not only a pure HTML template. [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) are widely used nowadays. Nonetheless [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) too. Should mention back-end too. There are [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) frameworks with template engines and cool widget systems.

The goal is to ship ready-to-use, comfortable to write, highly customizable dashboard components and ecosystem for customization.
